# <Daily-Planner-App>

## Description

The objective of this project was to develop a daily scheduler based on real-time hours.
It was created with the intention of enhancing my abilities while utilising Moment and the jQuery libraries.
The project employs colour coding to show how the scheduling relates to the current time and can store user data even when the browser is reloaded.
The major reason I created this project, among other things, was to better grasp the jQuery syntax and how it differs from standard JS.
